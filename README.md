# Hospitality-Domain



A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Problem Statement :

Atlig Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across
India. They have been in the hospitality industry for
the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other
competitors and ineffective decision-making in
management, Atlig Grands are losing its market
share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels
category. As a strategic move, the managing
director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate
“Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain
their market share and revenue. However, they do
not have an in-house data analytics team to provide
them with these insights.

Suggestions :

As per my observation , We are generating very less revenue from delhi as compared to others since Mumbai has the highest Revenue because most of
the revenue is coming from AtliQ Exotica and People like to visit in AtliQ Exotica . My suggestion is you should build one AtliQ Exotica in Delhi also or
you should provide the same service , offers and facilities in delhi hotels too as AtliQ Exotica.

Most of the Occupancy rate and Given Rating are coming from Delhi Properties (AtliQ Palace followed by AtliQ blu, AtliQ Grands ) and my Suggestion is you
should Provide more rooms as the occupancy rate is great in mentioned Properties or provide the same offers and facilities in Other's Properties as well
like those as mentioned.

As Observed We have high room availability on weekdays as compared to weekends so i suggest you try to find why we are not having more room
availability on weekends and provide offers and discounts to attract more bookings on weekends which will generate more revenue.

Try to research and find why we have high cancellation rate and what kind of
Facilities others hotels are providing which make them likable by people.
